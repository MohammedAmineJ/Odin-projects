    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic, layered Italian dish known for its comforting, hearty qualities. It consists of several layers of broad, flat pasta sheets, each carefully stacked with a rich filling. The layers are typically alternated with sauces and fillings, which may vary in texture and flavor, creating a satisfying blend of tastes. The dish is then baked until golden and bubbling, with the top often achieving a delicious, slightly crispy finish. The combination of textures — from the tender pasta to the smooth sauce and melted cheese — makes each bite indulgent and savory. Lasagna is often enjoyed as a special meal, perfect for gatherings or family dinners, and has a reputation for being both flavorful and filling.</p>
