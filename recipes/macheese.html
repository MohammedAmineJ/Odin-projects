    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Mac and cheese is a classic comfort food that combines tender pasta with a rich, creamy cheese sauce. The dish typically features elbow macaroni, though any pasta shape can work, enveloped in a velvety sauce made from butter, flour, milk, and plenty of melted cheese. The result is a warm, indulgent meal that's both cheesy and comforting. For added texture and flavor, mac and cheese is often baked with a crispy topping of more cheese or breadcrumbs, creating a golden crust. It's a versatile dish that can be enjoyed as a main course or a side, and it’s loved by both kids and adults for its simplicity and satisfying taste.</p>
